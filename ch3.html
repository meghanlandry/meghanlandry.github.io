    There are several different ways in which humans can fool their mind into wrongly perceiving the parameters of their bodies. These experiments reveal the suggestable nature of human perception and how much of sensation is in the mind. When talking about prosthetics, this might be sort of parallel to transparent technologies that become an extension of our minds and bodies. (The author also apparently wears Hawaiian shirts.) The things that we see can even be manipulated by the things we're told, ignoring stuff in plain sight, or by their position in our frame of view. The brain is "opportunistic" and will compromise and fix things automatically based on our prior knowledge and automatic processes. Circling again back to cyborgs, this "memory" or these processing can also be contained in tools and we can think of them similarly. Problem solving and language are also skills which depend upon outside knowledge.

    1. I think a good example is the times where I immediately forget something that I just did, just forgetting if I turned off a light or locked a door. Sometimes, I swear I feel my phone vibrating too, but there's no message or notification. The chapter example of sketching and not getting it right is relatable too.

    2. It makes you think about how useful language is and how it's helped us convey specific information so easily. I think the mangrove methaphor is unnecessarily complicated for a simple concept, but it, nevertheless, something I think is correct. I remember experiments being done on how people from certain languages that don't distinguish between green and blue can't tell subtle difference between the colors as people from languages that do. I also recall a study where people are more willing to say offensive things and not realize how bad they are in a secondary language, even if they're fluent, than in their first language. I think experiments like these are evidence that language influences how we think and perceive things.

    3. Meta knowledge is knowing how to find the answers, while constructive learning is building on what's already there. They have in common that they're not just rote memorization styles of learning, but are still very useful or problem solving. I guess I could learn an awareness of different learning styles so I can consciously employ them? I'm not sure if I'm understand what "this" is referring to in this question.

I don't really have any friends to do the tricks with, and I'd really rather just take a poor grade for this assignment than approach people I don't really know to do something like this.
