I would've liked this to be a little tidier, but I had snapped the leg off of my LED, disintegrated a significant portion of the motor wire, and twisted the resistor into a pretty sorry state, so I just left it in hopes of not damaging anything any further.
<br><br>
I made it into a bunny using some pieces of wire and the cotton from a bottle of vitamins. I thought this would be cute and maybe distract from the mess on top.

This is our group's strand. It's a little messy because the wires are different lengths. The hardest part was untangling it the second day. It's just following instructions, so there's not really much to say.
