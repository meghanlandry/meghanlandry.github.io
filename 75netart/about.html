      This site attempts to call attention to the problem of "outrage fatigue."<br><br>
      While it's important to be informed about what's going on in the world, lately it seems there are so many awful things happening that it's hard to focus on any one of them.
      It's especially difficult to watch yourself become apathetic toward things that might have set you off a year ago because the bombardement of scandals and tragedies has you completely desensitized.
      The videos on this site were a fraction of important stories from a very small span of 1-2 weeks, and none of them will be important a week from now (November 8th, 2018).
