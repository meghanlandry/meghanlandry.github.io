    The Balance<br>
    Photoshop, Live2D<br><br>
    I came up with this project as my final for ART 75. I’d seen Live2D used in some mobile games,
    and I thought it would be neat to learn, so I wanted to make a project around it. I did this through
    pretty traditional brainstorming, just writing out ideas on paper of what was on my mind. After a
    lot of time struggling with what direction to even take it, I decided to use my indecision as the
    basis for the project. I always feel like I’m being pulled between the art that I should do, the art
    that I’m expected to do, art that sells, and art that I need to do in order to get better, so I painted
    a picture for each division and designed the project to blend all four in the piece as a whole and
    learned to use Live2D in order to do the animation. I think that this project sums up my
    approach to art. I try to make something with a broad appeal but that also appeals to me, almost
    always with the intent of learning something, and only including crafted social narratives when
    prompted, like in a school setting.<br><br>

    ‘Til the Forest Met the Sea<br>
    Acrylic on Masonite<br><br>
    This was done while I was going to school in the Midwest. We’d had record rainfall and a lot of
    flooding. I lived on a river, so you could go by and see the playground equipment and park
    pavilions along the river almost completely covered in river water. So that was the inspiration for
    this painting. The narrative is a guardian of the forest who falls in love with the guardian of a
    body of water. She makes the rain fall until her forest is part of the body of water too.

    E--<br>
    Photoshop<br><br>
    This is a drawing of my character in the mmorpg FFXIV. I just wanted to draw her for fun and to
    practice incorporating some painting techniques. I like to do at least one drawing of my
    character from any game I play that has customization, so I guess it was less inspiration and
    more an inevitability.<br><br>
