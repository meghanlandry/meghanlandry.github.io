<i>Phase I</i>
<br><br>
We traced an angle from Google to make an equalateral triangle, cut it out, and traced it to all have the same size. Then, we created our matching design side by each drawing a few shapes along an edge of the triangle and then just cutting them all out. The experience has not been great because of the confusing nature of the assignment and the extremely short time frame for the initial due date. We sort of figured it out eventually.
<br><br><br>

<br><br>There isn't a whole lot to say about this set of triangles. I imagined the group drawn edge as a field with hills, mountains, and trees, so I tried to create edges that also played into a natural setting with clouds and waves, so that the scene could perhaps be a floating island over the ocean.

<br><br>
<i>Phase II</i>
<br><br>
These are the first iterations for my two design sets. I went with a space theme because they have simple shapes that I find appealing. For the interlocking shapes one, I just made moons and stars that fit into each other. For the tab one, I made a landscape sort of scene with clouds and a moon and starts and planets that can be changed around.

<br>
<i>Test I</i>
<br><br>
We spent most of our two time slots trying to figure out the process for printing, so we only got a few pieces cut. These are mine. It's only the first set which is the interlocking one. The circles and starts fit as they should, but the notches ended up being too thin and don't fit together. The time slot was up before we were able to print the other set or of course fix the problems.

<i>Test II</i>
<br><br>
I adjusted my pieces and cut them on acrylic. The adjusted set worked this time. I also tried my second set that uses tabs. Unforunately, they don't quite fit together. My laser time ended before I could further adjust, and I was unable to reserve a slot for just printing my own shapes.

<br><br>
<i>Phase VI</i>
<br><br>
Our original idea was a pretty plain tree. From there we moved onto a world suspended between two trees. Our final idea settled on combining different worlds. We came up with four themes and assigned one to each person via coin flip. Mine was underwater, Evan had fantasy, Jessica science fiction, and Jason horror. Unfortunately due to some absences, we were already a week late getting going, and further complicating things were many other issues including most of the laser times being taken by the time any of us got to the sheet, small mistakes that took up a lot of time misprinting pieces, and of course the school closing and cutting our laser time short. We were only able to get a single set of most of the pieces cut, nowhere near the required forty, but it certainly wasn't for lack of effort.
