This was the test arrangement. I didn't get it the first day because I bought the wrong resistors, which were way too strong.

This is our group's box. We used my box. I didn't get any documentation from the show since it was only open during times that I had class and we didn't go down as a group. I'll try to swipe footage from someone else if possible. The box can be seen functioning in our video though.

<br><br>
As for the group duties, I put the box together, decorated it, put together the code, and was briefly in the video.
