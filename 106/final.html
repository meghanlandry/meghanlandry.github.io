My original plan was to make a sculpture sort of piece, but it had limited interactivity and thus didn't fit the class assigment. In lieu of what I wanted to do, I upgraded the LCD box I'd worked on for the <a href="prototype.html">Prototype project</a>. I wanted to add a weather sensor, servo wheels, and a force sensitive resistor, so the box could talk about the weather, respond to the conversation with motion, and know when it's being picked up, respectively. I also wanted to update the code with pixel animals and binary "art" and to better manage the memory and implement the task scheduler library.

<br><br>I didn't take any pictures of the progress. I kind of just get in the zone and forget. :( Here are a few pictures from Maker Faire though.<br><br>

In the end, the wheels and servos I got were way too big for my box, so I abandoned that idea. The binary art I had planned to make with random numbers, concatinated strings, customChar, and byte arrays, but found out that you can't just simply put a string in a byte array, so that didn't come to be. The rest I did accomplish.

The video doesn't have any sound as the project doesn't have any and doesn't really need a verbal explanation on what it's doing.
