I would've liked this to be a little tidier, but I had snapped the leg off of my LED, disintegrated a significant portion of the motor wire, and twisted the resistor into a pretty sorry state, so I just left it in hopes of not damaging anything any further.
<br><br>
I made it into a bunny using some pieces of wire and the cotton from a bottle of vitamins. I thought this would be cute and maybe distract from the mess on top. It doesn't really get very far, but it's very good at spinning.

This is our group's strand. It's a little messy because the wires are different lengths. The hardest part was untangling it the second day. It's just following instructions, so there's not really much to say.
