I'm not very sure how far back this can go, so apologies if some of it is irrelevant.
During my first semester at SJSU, I participated in a small gallery show with my Intro to Digital Video Class.
Because I'm focused on digital painting, I show my work primarily online and have displayed my work in online galleries for several years.
I received a Daily Deviation on DeviantArt for one of my traditional paintings. This exposed my work to several thousands of viewers and was a nice achievement. 
I participated in gallery shows at my community college (Spoon River College).
I sold art and spoke at a panel at a small annual convention hosted by my hometown's community library (Havana Public Library).
I participated in yearly regional shows (Prairieland Art Conference) in high school and won best of show my senior year and numerous other awards.
While in junior high and high school, I showed my work and won best of show and other awards in the arts division of annual local 4-H fairs (Mason County 4-H Fair) and exhibited in the state 4-H fair (Illinois State Fair).
