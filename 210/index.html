      <h3>Project Title</h3>
      <br>
      <h1>Cold Like the Sun</h1>
      (Meghan Landry)
      <br>
      <br><br>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <br>
      <p class="justify">This animation very, very loosely responds to modern admiration of all things superficially “natural” and the anti-human, anti-science sentiment stemming from it.
        The character is not exactly a personification of nature, but more a superhuman idol representative of nature in this context.
        While fantasy portrayals of characters like these tend to be gentle, wise guardians, this aims to present its character as equally alluring but also detached and uncaring, a perpetuator of life and death, neither good nor evil.
        There's not much else to say, as much of what is meant to conveyed is atmosphere and feeling.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <h3>Description</h3>
      <br>
      <p class="justify">The animation will span roughly four minutes and be loopable.
        All illustrations in the animation will be painted in Photoshop and put into 2.5D motion though a combination of Live2D and After Effects and compiled in Premiere.
        Project will be created in a pink, dark blue, and light neutrals color scheme, reflective of my own aesthetic preference and of the intended mood of the animation.
        Music will likely be sampled from several royalty free found tracks and remixed into a song fitting the final animation.
        The finished work is intended to be visually entertaining for a shallow viewing with more subtle themes and symbolism for a viewer looking for a deeper read.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h3>Location</h3>
      <br>
      <p class="justify">Work is assumed to be displayed in virtual 3D gallery for the BFA show, but is more at home on public display through a shareable link or embedded in my personal site for continual display until my progression makes the work
        too repulsive to show.</p>
        <br>
        <img id="gallery" src="images/gallery.jpg">
      <br><br>
      <h3>Timeline</h3>
      <br>
      <p class="justify">Work is expected to take the entirety of a semester. A list of milestones is listed below to be placed on a timeline when nature of course is clearer and deadlines are known.</p>
      Sketch, Line art, Base colors, & Paint all Assets<br>
      Animate Live2D & After Effects character pieces<br>
      Animate environment<br>
      Composite pieces in Premiere<br>
      Stitch together Music<br>
      Bask in inevitable disappointment at final outcome<br>
      <br><br>

      <h3>Bio</h3>
      <br>
      <p class="justify">
        I work mostly through digital tools, primarily Photoshop and presently Live2D.
        I live in the San Jose, California but was born in Maryland and lived most of my life in rural Illinois.
        I have an associates degree with a focus in art from Spoon River Community College in Canton, Illinois and am a semester shy of my bachelors as a Digital Media Art major at San Jose State University in San Jose, California.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
      <p class="justify">
        I am a digital illustrator first, but I love to work with a variety of media, both digital and traditional across 2D and 3D. I’m continually trying to improve my technical skills and searching for new ways to enhance my illustrations and make
        them come to life. I specialize in character and creature depictions and designs and more often than not feature them as the subjects of my work.
        <br>
        I often create works that are soft and beautiful with a peaceful, comforting mood as a base and then warp them a little bit with darker or deeper undertones. I think we sometimes might hold our lizard brain in contempt, but I see it as a tool
        to drive engagement with more important themes. My mom used to mix medicine with a teaspoon of honey when I was little, and I think that’s the approach I want to take with art, a thick layer of beauty and magic with a little pill of something
        to think about.
        <br>
        I keep politics, social issues, and self-expression subtle, but mortality, feminism, and self expression are not uncommon themes underpinning my work. I’m fascinated and terrified by my own and our species’ collective mortality, and I find
        art to be an excellent tool to work through the web of ideas around that topic in particular and find a universal means of connection through the discussion of a shared fate.
        <br>
        My current goal as an artist is to work as a character designer, illustrator, or sculptor for games, so a lot of my art is also practice in that pursuit. I find games to be a powerful narrative tool and a way to connect with characters and
        ideas and worlds that just hits a little differently than books or film. I have no special goal to exhibit in a gallery or garner notoriety, and I favor the online, continually and easily available platforms found online for displaying work.
