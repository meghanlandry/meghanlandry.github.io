The author offers an expanded interpretation of the word 'cyborg,' which includes any modification that creates a hybrid with the mind. He states that humans have been turning into cyborgs for a long time, and that part of our mind is the external tech we use to expand our knowledge and abilities.
<br><br>
Cyborgs were originally thought to be a way to transport people into space through modification of the body rather than trying to modify the environment in space. One of the first experiments creating such a cyborg was attaching an injection pump to a rat's tail. An important aspect is that the pump and other cybernetic systems be self regulating as to be more natural and less noticeable.
<br><br>
Tech expanded to humans with one person even connecting a device direcrly to his nerves. A more practical example is cochlear implants. The author argues that these machines that interact with our minds and bodies should be considered part of our 'selves.'
<br><br><br>
1. Klines and Clynes' cyborgs were actual alterations of a body with tech parts. Clark instead wants to expand this definition to include external technology that enhances the mind.
<br><br>
2. Any of the systems in a body are self-regulating, the circulatory and endocrine for example, and homeostasis describes them collectively. A pacemaker is an example of a tech that mimics that system and is similarly self-regulating.
<br><br>
3. In media culture, a cyborg is any human-tech/robot hybrid. Ghost in the Shell comes to mind since most of the characters could be called cyborgs in a traditional sense, but Marvel's Cable is a recently relevant example too.

Technology can be on a spectrum of transparent to opaque, from noticeable or awkward and thought requiring to natural and not noticeable. The author talks about how technology has become more transparent over time. He uses the example of a wristwatch and a dictionary at the respective ends of that spectrum.
<br>
While there is a wide variance in tech tools, they have the common thread of being human centered and the future of us as cyborgs depends on thr innovation and development of those tools.
<br><br><br>
1. Opaque technology is technology that is noticeable and potentially awkward to use. You're actively aware it's there. Transparent technology is tech that we've gotten so used to using that we don't even notice using it.
<br><br>
2. Anything safety related should probably be opaque. You should notice unlocking a security door or entering an important code. However, stuff that you use all the time to do everyday tasks, like a keyboard and mouse or your phone are better the more transparent they are.
<br><br>
3. It fits for the time period, but these pieces of tech have changed since the early 2000's. Watches now can be clunky since people are more accustomed to looking at digital clocks, and I regularly look up words in the way the author says people don't because Google is seconds away on my phone. However, if you replace the watch with just looking at the time on my phone or just having a general awareness of time due to tech then it's certainly valid even now.
