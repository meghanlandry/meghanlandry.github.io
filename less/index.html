    Obviously this is an unfinished work, a not even close to finished work.
    <br><br>
    I’ve been really, really sick throughout the whole semester and was unable to fulfill what were challenging but reasonable goals when I’d set them for myself. (It makes me so angry!! I hate it!)
    <br><br>
    However, I will be finishing this.
    <br><br>
    Even if no one sees it, it’s still very important to me. But please check back in the fall if this project interests you! Please also feel free to check out my website to see my prior, finished work.
