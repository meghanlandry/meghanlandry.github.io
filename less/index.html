      <h1>Cold Like the Sun: A Work in Progress</h1>
      <br><br>
      And that's more or less it (for now).
      <br><br>
      Obviously this is an unfinished work, a not even <span class="emph">close</span> to finished work.
      <br><br>
      I’ve been really, really sick throughout the whole semester and was unable to fulfill what were challenging but reasonable goals when I’d set them for myself and before all of this happened. (This is so upsetting for me, and I <span class="emph">hate</span> to have been so incapacitated as to be unable to work on something that I've desperetely wanted to.)
      <br><br>
      However, I <span class="emph">will</span> be finishing this.
      <br><br>
      Even if no one sees it, it’s still very important to me. So please check on this URL in the fall if this project interests you! Please also feel free to check out my website linked below if you'd like to see my prior, more finished work.

      <h1>Vision</h1>
      <br><br>
      <h2>Technical Details</h2>
    This work is planned to be a loopable animation roughly four minutes in length. The assets will be painted in Photoshop then be rigged and animated in Cubism Live2D with potential supplemental animation done in After Effects, in particular for the environment. Scenes will then be built and edited in Premiere. The animation will have atmospherically appropriate music sourced from royalty free artists.
    <br><br>  <h2>Description</h2>
      This will be a looping character animation that heavily uses elements of nature as the central aesthetic. The work is intended to be broadly beautiful and utilize many elements of nature that people generally find attractive, such as flowers, lightning, celestial bodies, rainfall, snow, birds in flight, etc. However, the work will also be underscored with macabre or slightly unsettling representations of the death, disease, and destruction that are also inherent to nature.

The character at the center of the animation will take the form of a young woman. She is intended to be reminiscent of a superhuman mythical figure. Though she appears human, her personality will be detached and passive to the environment around her despite her role in its cycle.

The environment will have some temporal elements. It will shift through the seasons (not the California type, the kind that has snow and storms) but over the course of a single sun and moon day cycle.

Several animals will also pass in and out of the animation.

The animation will be presented as a simple HD video with audio.

    <h1>Previous Iteration</h1>
    <br><br>
    Cold Like the Sun was an idea I'd been planning as my culminating thesis project for some time. Out of an abundance of impatience and reckless optimism, I tried to make this idea happen as the final project for another class. I had one month and had not fleshed out character designs or a storyboard, and was a novice at best in the program I used to make it. However, it it helped me scout out what I did and didn't like about my idea and better prepared me take on the more complex and fulfilled version I'm working on now.

    <h1>Artist Bio</h1>
    <br><br>
    Meghan Landry was born in Maryland, grew up in rural Illinois, and in 2016 moved to San Jose, California. She has maintained an interest in drawing and crafting since early childhood. She attends San Jose State University as a Digital Media Art student.<br><br>
Meghan's broad yet distractible curiosity has led her to pick up many different kinds of media, both digital and traditional, but digital tools and software are where most of her time is spent. She is primarily a character illustrator using Photoshop and a graphics tablet. She also has an interest in organic sculpting in ZBrush, animation in Live2D and After Effects, and web coding, generally all to the end of adapting or enhancing her illustrations. She highly regards technical proficiency and aims to set and achieve certain visions for her art on a technical and personal aesthetic level and to be perpetually learning and critically evaluating her work. She continues to create and explore art as the function of a basic drive to do so.

  <div id="statement" class="text">
    <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
    <br><br>
    I am a digital illustrator first and foremost, but I love to explore all sorts of different tools and media to create new things. I’m continually working to improve my technical skills and further develop a defined personal aesthetic. I specialize in fantasy character and creature depictions and designs and more often than not feature them front and center in my art. My goal as an artist is to work as a character designer, illustrator, or sculptor for games, and a lot of my art is also practice in that pursuit. I find gaming to be a powerful and ever-evolving narrative tool that lets its audience connect with characters and ideas and worlds in a more personal and effective way that’s difficult to achieve with more passive media.
    <br><br>
The basis for my illustrations is usually soft, flowing, and beautiful with a peaceful and comforting atmosphere that can be enjoyed on a surface level. However, I like to also include darker or deeper themes through a warping of something conventionally beautiful or as a beautiful idealization of an ugly or uncomfortable idea. I think we sometimes might hold our lizard brain in contempt, but I see it as a potential gateway to more enthusiastically engage with difficult ideas.
<br><br>
I keep politics and social issues subtle, but death, feminism, and self expression are not uncommon sources of inspiration. I’m fascinated and terrified by my own and our species’ collective mortality, and I find art to be an excellent tool to work through the web of ideas around that topic in particular and find a universal means of connection through the discussion of a shared fate. Similarly, the social policing of women’s bodies and behavior is always something on my mind when creating character art, and I hope my art serves as an act of reclamation, both of the female form and of some elements of once oppressive traditional femininity.
<br><br>
Cold Like the Sun is intended to be an animated digital painting created with Photoshop, Live2D, and Premiere. It very, very loosely responds to modern admiration of all things superficially “natural” and the anti-human, anti-science sentiment stemming from it. The character is not exactly a personification of nature, but more a superhuman idolic representative of it. While fantasy portrayals of characters like these tend to be gentle, wise guardians, this narrative aims to present its character as equally alluring but also detached and uncaring, a passive perpetuator of life and death, neither good nor evil. This is mostly inspiration and an undercurrent to the work, and the animation is intended to be entertaining and reflective without needing the aforementioned context.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, barely prior to the start of the semester and this work, I received a diagnosis of Hodgkin’s lymphoma. While I’m lucky that this type of cancer is often curable and that it was caught at an early stage, it still means six months of chemotherapy, presently ongoing. Every other Thursday morning, I’m given a handful of pills and then injected with life-saving poison for six hours. The side effects are not minor and the Pavlovian response is so strong that I feel ill and panicked even writing this brief statement about it.
<br><br>
Thus, my grand and carefully planned idea has resulted in this, my best effort, full of anger and shame and hurting pride. It’s a hodgepodge of loose ends and unfinished work, desperately trying to be everything I wanted and inevitably failing. Even so, I hope this mess can act as a catalyst for hope and potential because, while May 7th is a delivery date my fulfilled vision will miss, I will certainly see this project through to the end, just maybe a couple months late.
