  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
<p>I'm Meghan. I'm a DMA major. I have a lot of experience with several products in the Adobe Suite, but Premiere is completely new to me. Even though I don't plan to work with video as a career, given how prominent YouTube and self-advertising is for artists especially, I think it will still be a relevant and useful skill to learn. I value aesthetics and technical skill in art, so since this is a concentration and medium I'm unfamiliar with and the class seems to heavily focus on social commentary, this is probably going to be a pretty difficult semester for me, but I'll be doing my best!  </p>
