            This small site is responding to the idea of losing connection with our physical bodies as driven by COVID-19 social distancing. I added a mosaic to the limbs for the blurring of the physical body as a significant part of the self. The helmet is supposed to be reminiscent of both an astronaut helmet and of a gas mask. For the latter, a USB port and cord are where an oxygen supply would be connected for a mask, so it's like the oxygen is a flow of information receding into space. The rectangle on the helmet is an inward facing screen. It's in space for the distancing from other people save for a digital connection. I made the hair look sort of alien to imply that the figure is a little dangerous too in order to note the need to be responsible for our own dangerous presence.
